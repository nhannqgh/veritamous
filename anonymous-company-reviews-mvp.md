# Veritamous - MVP Specification

## ðŸ“‹ Introduction

**Veritamous** is a platform that allows employees to share reviews about their companies in a completely anonymous and secure way. Using **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** technology, the platform ensures that employees can verify their employment status without revealing their personal identity.

### Main Objectives:
- **Privacy-First**: Fully protect the identity of the reviewer
- **Verifiable**: Ensure only real employees can submit reviews
- **Transparent**: Provide reliable review information for job seekers
- **Anonymous**: Reviews cannot be linked to the author

## ðŸš€ Core Features of the MVP

### 1. Email Domain Verification with ZK Proof

**Description**: The system verifies employees through their company email using ZK proof.

**Requirements**:
- Employees must have an email with the official company domain
- Verify email access without revealing the specific email address
- Generate a nullifier to prevent duplicate reviews

**How it works**:
1. **Challenge Generation**: The system sends a verification code to the company email
2. **ZK Proof Creation**: The employee creates a ZK proof to prove:
   - They have access to an email with the company domain
   - They know the verification code sent
   - They have not submitted a review before
3. **Proof Verification**: The system verifies the proof without knowing the specific email
4. **Nullifier Storage**: Store the nullifier to prevent duplicate reviews

### 2. Anonymous Review Submission

**Description**: Allows verified employees to submit anonymous reviews.

**Requirements**:
- Simple interface for writing reviews
- Support for category-based ratings (culture, compensation, work-life balance, etc.)
- Rating system (1-5 stars) for each category
- Free text for pros/cons/advice

**How it works**:
1. **Verification Check**: Check if the user has completed ZK verification
2. **Review Form**: Display the review form with the following fields:
   - Overall rating (1-5)
   - Category ratings (work-life balance, compensation, culture, management, career growth)
   - Text fields (title, pros, cons, advice to management)
   - Employment info (department, role level, employment status)
3. **Anonymous Submission**: Submit the review without any identity information
4. **Nullifier Usage**: Use the nullifier to ensure one-review-per-employee

### 3. Company Directory

**Requirements**:
- Database of companies with basic information

### 4. Review Display & Aggregation
